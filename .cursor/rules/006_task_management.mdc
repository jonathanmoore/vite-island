# Project Tasks Management

## Purpose

The `.ai/TASKS.md` file serves as a working document for tracking specific implementation tasks, progress, and testing status. It breaks down the higher-level requirements from PLAN.md into actionable work items.

## Structure

Organize the TASKS.md file with a simple, task-oriented structure:

```markdown
# Project Tasks

## In Progress
- [ ] Task 1: Specific implementation detail
  - [x] Subtask 1.1
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2
- [ ] Task 2: Another specific task

## Ready for Implementation
- [ ] Task 3: Ready to be worked on
- [ ] Task 4: Details about what needs to be done

## Completed
- [x] Task 5: Implemented and tested 
- [x] Task 6: Completed functionality

## Test Status
- [x] Test for Feature 1: All tests passing
- [ ] Test for Feature 2: 3/5 tests passing
  - Failing: test_case_name (reason for failure)
```

## Task Guidelines

1. **Specificity**: Each task should be specific enough to be actionable
2. **Scope**: Tasks should be small enough to complete in a reasonable timeframe
3. **Dependencies**: Note any dependencies between tasks
4. **Testing**: Link tasks to their corresponding test cases

## Using Tasks for Development

1. **Test-Driven Approach**:
   - Create test cases for each task first
   - Implement functionality to pass the tests
   - Mark tests as passing in the Test Status section

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Move tasks between sections as their status changes
   - Add completion dates to finished tasks
   - Document any obstacles or issues directly in the task description

3. **Continuous Updates**:
   - Update the file as work progresses
   - Add new tasks as they are identified
   - Refine task descriptions as understanding improves

## Status Indicators

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[~]` - In progress (optional)
- `[!]` - Blocked or has issues (optional)
