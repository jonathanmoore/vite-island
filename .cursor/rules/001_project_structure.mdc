# Project Structure

This project follows the Islands Architecture pattern, which focuses on isolated interactive components within mostly static HTML.

## Directory Organization

- `src/islands/`: Web components (custom elements)
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions, shared classes, and core code
- `tests/`: Test files for components and utilities
- `public/`: Static assets
- `src/`: Other application files

## Key Files

- `@src/main.js`: Application entry point that initializes island components
- `@src/lib/islands.js`: Core loading system for island components
- `@src/lib/utils.js`: Animation and UI utility functions

## Progressive Enhancement

All interactive components should:
1. Work without JavaScript first (static HTML)
2. Be enhanced with JavaScript when loaded
3. Support conditional loading via attributes:
   - `client:visible`: Load when scrolled into view
   - `client:media="(...)`: Load based on media queries
   - `client:idle`: Load when browser is idle
